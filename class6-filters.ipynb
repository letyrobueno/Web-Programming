    "## Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where should we implement features that are not related to the business logic? For example: logging to the system, error handling, authorization, etc;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filters**: classes that are not executed before and/or after a request;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a package filter in the project and inside it we create a class `ExampleOfFilter` that implements the class `javax.servlet.Filter`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@WebFilter(\"/myfilter\")\n",
    "public class ExampleOfFilter implements Filter {\n",
    "\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void destroy() {\n",
    "\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,\n",
    "        FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {\n",
    "        // add code to be executed before the request\n",
    "        chain.doFilter(request, response);\n",
    "        // add code to be executed after the request\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void init(FilterConfig arg0) throws ServletException {\n",
    "\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "* `Filter` has three methods that must be implemented: `init()`, `destroy()` and `doFilter()`. It is in the method `doFilter()` that we will add the code to be executed before and/or after a request being answered by our application. You can leave the other two methods empty, but their structure must be in the code. The annotation `@WebFilter(\"/myfilter\")` indicates the request url that must be sent by the filter. The option `urlPatterns = {\"/*\"}` indicates that the filter must be called before all application requests. **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@WebFilter(\"/mvc\") // only requests to \"mvc\" will go by this filter\n",
    "@WebFilter(urlPatterns = {\"/*\"}) // all requests will go by this filter\n",
    "@WebFilter(urlPatterns = {\"/mvc\", \"/mvc2\"}) // only requests to \"mvc\" and \"mvc2\" will go by this filter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the project `onlineapp` and modify it by creating a filter to measure the execution time of the application:\n",
    "      \n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws \n",
    "    IOException, ServletException {\n",
    "\n",
    "    long initialTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n",
    "\n",
    "    chain.doFilter(request, response);\n",
    "\n",
    "    long finalTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n",
    "    String uri = ((HttpServletRequest) request).getRequestURI();\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Time of the request in \" + uri + \" was: \" + (finalTime - initialTime));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Donâ€™t forget to add the import: `import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;`\n",
    "\n",
    "And to add the annotation: `@WebFilter(\"/mvc\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizing the Connections with the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "In the same project, create a filter named `FilterConnection` that will be responsible for managing the connections with the database:\n",
    "      \n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws \n",
    "    IOException, ServletException {\n",
    "    try {\t\t\t\n",
    "        Connection conn = new ConnectionFactory().getConnection();\n",
    "        // it provides a connection to the request\n",

    "\n",
    "        chain.doFilter(request, response);\n",
