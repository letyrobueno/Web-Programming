    "# Web Programming in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to learn and remember a little about object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, let’s develop a desktop Java application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall:**\n",
    "* public classes require the same name for the file;\n",
    "* `private`: data is accessible only inside the class. It can be used for attributes, constructors and methods; \n",
    "* `public`: data is accessible from any other file, even from files in other folders (in this case, we need to add an `import`). It can be used for classes, attributes, constructors and methods; \n",
    "* without `private` nor `public`: data is accessible only to files in the same folder; \n",
    "* `protected`: data is accessible to all classes in the same package, as well as to all classes that extend this class, even if they are not in the same package. It can be used for attributes, constructors and methods; \n",
    "* `packages`: group classes with similar or related functions. Sun/Oracle pattern: the name is related to the name of the company that developed the application. **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ca.edu.collegeX.webprog.package1;\n",
    "ca.edu.collegeX.webprog.package2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "              \n",
    "    where `collegeX` is the company name; `webprog` is the project's name; `package1` and `package2` are two folders inside the project `webprog`; \n",
    "* A `static` attribute is not anymore an attribute of each object, but a class attribute, which means the information is stored in the class; it's not particular to each object.\n",
    "* `@Override`: it notifies the compiler that we are overriding a method from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a desktop Java application:**\n",
    "1. Inside Eclipse, choose `File`, then `New` and `Java Project`. Give a name for the project and then click `Finish`.\n",
    "2. Assuming `enrollSys` as the name of the project, create a package named `ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.model` by right-clicking over the folder `src`, and choosing the option `New` and next `Package`.\n",
    "3. Inside the package, create a class called `Student` by right-clicking over the package, and choosing `New` and then `Class`. The class should have the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "package ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.model;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Student {\n",
    "    private Long id;\n",
    "    private String name;\n",
    "    private String email;\n",
    "    private String address;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we created the attribute `id` with type `Long`, not `long`, because `Long` initialize the attribute with default value `null`. This prevents errors in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now we convert the class `Student` in a javabean. **Javabeans** are classes with a constructor without arguments and with access methods of type `get` and `set`. To make that automatically in Eclipse, use the shortcut `Ctrl + 3` and type `generate`. Among the options, select `Generate Getters and Setters`. In the next window, select `all attributes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a package named `ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.tests` by right-clicking over the folder `src`, option `New` and then `Package`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Inside this new package, create a class named `CreateStudent` by right-clicking over the package, option `New` then `Class`. The class should have the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "package ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.tests;\n",
    "\n",
    "import ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.model.Student;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class CreateStudent {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {\n",
    "        Student student = new Student();\n",
    "        student.setName(\"Jack\");\n",
    "        student.setEmail(\"jack@gmail.com\");\n",
    "        student.setAddress(\"Av. Sherbrooke, 5001\");\n",
    "        student.setId((long) 3);\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(student .getName());\n",
    "        System.out.println(student .getEmail());\n",
    "        System.out.println(student .getAddress());\n",
    "        System.out.println(student .getId());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Now create an array of the type `Student` and store data of some students in it. Make a loop to list all of them. Here two ways of doing this:\n",
