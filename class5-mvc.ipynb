In theory, we could implement one only servlet for all application by sending every logic and its operations to the same servlet, and inside it we would indicate the corresponding action for each one by using a `switch` or `if` statement.\n",
    "**Disadvantage**: the servlet would be gigantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let’s use polymorphism. Modify the project `onlineapp` and make it completely MVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**. In the package `ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.servlet`, modify the class `ControllerServlet` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@WebServlet(\"/mvc\")\n",
    "protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**. Create a package `ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.logic` and, inside it, create an interface called `Logic` with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface Logic {\n",
    "    void execute(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**. Still in the package `ca.edu.collegeX.enrollSys.logic`, create a class `InsertStudent` to insert students into the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class InsertStudent implements Logic {\n",
    "\t@Override\n",
    "\tpublic void execute(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception {\n",
    "\t\t// it searches parameters from request object\n",
    "\t\tString name = request.getParameter(\"name\");\n",
    "\t\tString email = request.getParameter(\"email\");\n",
    "\t\tString address = request.getParameter(\"address\");\n",

    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**. In the JSP file, attention to the details of the form whose action must be equal to the one in the `@WebServlet` mapped in the servlet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<form name=\"register\" id=\"form\" action=\"mvc\" method=\"POST\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**. Still in the JSP file, attention to the hidden input. The value sent to the servlet through this field must be equal to the name of the class that must be instantiated inside the servlet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Insert\" onclick=\"set('InsertStudent')\"/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. Create classes `UpdateStudent` and `RemoveStudent` to modify and remove a student, respectively. Add the three operations (insertion, update and removal) and also listing all students, where each line presents a checkbox to ease the choice of the record (as we made in the previous class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instead of implementing each logic to redirect to a JSP file, make the method execute return a string with the page address to which we must redirect. Then make the servlet use this string to redirect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The logic `InsertStudent` and `UpdateStudent` are very similar. Try to create one only version for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attaching data to a request\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to make an operation in a database, and after the operation is successful, we want to forward the request to another page. For example, suppose we want to insert a student through the application `onlineapp`. Since we shouldn’t abuse of Java code in the middle of HTML, we are going to use taglib. We do not need to change anything in the JSP file from which the request is coming. We just need to change the logic and the JSP file that will subsequently receive the request. So in the class `InsertStudent` we would make (in this case, the method `execute()` is not implemented with `return` and the redirecting is made directly in the logic):\n",
